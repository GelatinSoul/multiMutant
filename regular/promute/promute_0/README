NOTE: The mutator code was originally part of the rMutant_2 project
but has been edited in order to work as Promute.  Part of this
modification is that all mutations now rely on SCWRL.

This program invokes scwrl to perform an in silico mutation of a
single residue in a given protein into a target residue. ProMute can
reason about multiple chains.

Installing Promute
-------------------------
1. cd into the promute folder.
2. run make in the command line.
3. cd into the build folder in order to invoke the rMutant program.

Invoking promute
-------------------------
ProMute used stand-alone is for mutating a single
residue. Format/order of the command line arguments:

1. pdbID : 4 alphanumeric PDB ID, or ID for already mutated file
2. chainID : 1 character chain where the mutation is performed
3. residueNumber : residue number on which the mutation is to be performed
4. mutationTarget : 1 character of target amino acid
5. runEnergyMinimization : optional argument for forcing or denying
                           energy minimization.  Value needs to be 'no'
                           to deny running EM, or 'em' to force it to run
                           EM, or "srem" which will invoke EM but only if
			   the residue being mutated has a significant
			   solvent accessible surface area (SASA)
			   

Example invocations
-------------------------
# in silico mutate residue 80 of chain A of 1HHP to a methionine
./proMute 1HHP A 80 M

# in silico mutate residue 1 of chain B of 1am7 to a alanine
./proMute 1am7 b 1 a

# if the first example has been run, in silico mutate residue 10 of chain A
# of the 1HHP that has already been mutated to a glycine
./proMute 1HHP.A80M A 10 G

# in silico mutate residue 80 of chain A of 1HHP to a methionine without EM
./proMute 1HHP A 80 M no

# in silico mutate residue 80 of chain A of 1HHP to a serine with EM
./proMute 1HHP A 80 S em

# in silico mutate residue 80 of chain A of 1HHP to a serine with EM
  but only if SASA criteria has been met
./proMute 1HHP A 80 S srem


Invoking proMuteBatch
---------------------

proMuteBatch creates a script, that can be invoked, which will in turn
invoke proMute. ProMuteBatch can be informed mutliple targets/mutants
to be produced

Format/order of the command line arguments:

1. pdbID : 4 character alphanumeric PDB ID, or extended ID for already
           mutated files
2. chainIDs : 3 characters in the format startChain:endChain.
3. residueNumbers : residue numbers on which the separate mutations will be
                    performed. Ranges are denoted with a colon, individual
		    residues and ranges are separated with commas. X in the
		    start of a range denotes all residues before the end
		    residue.  X in the end of a range denotes all residues
		    after the start residue.  X:X denotes all residues.
4. mutationTargets : 1 character representation of what the residue is being
                     mutated to, X for all possible targets, pol for polar
					 targets, char for charged targets, phobic for hydrophobic
					 targets.
5. scriptFile : the script that is created

Example invocations
-------------------------
# mutate residues 96 through the end of protein 1hvr in chains A and B to
# alanine
./proMuteBatch 1hvr A:B 96:X A

# mutate residues 3 and 10 through 16 of protein 2ped chain A to the
# hydrophobic amino acids
./proMuteBatach 2ped A:A 3,10:16 phobic
